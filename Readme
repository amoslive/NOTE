Optimization problem

In mathematics and computer science, an optimization problem is the problem of finding the best solution from all feasible solutions. 



Convolution

Consider a dynamic system, in which an input signal, say x(t), enters a “black box”, S, and is output as y(t):

Mathematically, we represent the “black box” system as S:

     y(t) = S[x(0 to t)]

where y(t) represents the output signal at time t, and x(0 to t) represents the time history of the input signal. 
If the “black box” represents a convolution, it means that S takes on the following mathematical form:
